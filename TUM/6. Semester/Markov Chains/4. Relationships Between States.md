# Reachability
- A state $j \in E$ is reachable from $i \in E$, if the following holds: 
$$\exists n \in \mathbb N_0: P(X_n = j\mid X_0 = i) \gt 0$$
- We denote this as $j \to i$
$$ i \to j \Leftrightarrow \exists n : \Pi^{n}(i, j)>0 \Leftrightarrow \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \Pi^n(i, j)\gt 0$$
- Reachability is only determined by whether $(\Pi(i,j))_{i, j \in E}$ are positive or zero, and it is therefore determined by the transition graph 
## Communication
- States **communicate** if $j \to i$ and $i \to j$ (or simply $i \leftrightarrow j$)
- Commuication is an **equivalence relation**, meaning there are **communication classes** in the state space
### Reducability
- If $E$ only has one communication class, i.e $\forall i, j: i\leftrightarrow j$, then the MC is **irreducible**, otherwise it is C
### Closed sets
- A set $I \subseteq E$ is called closed, if you can't leave the set: 
$$\forall i \in I: \sum_{j \in I}\Pi(i, j) = 1$$
- Or equivalently:
$$\forall i \in I, j \not \in E: \Pi(i, j) = 0$$
# Periodicity
- Let $i \in E$ be a state and define $T(i)= \{n \ge 1: \Pi^n(i, i) > 0\}$
- The **period** of $i$ is defined as $\gcd(T(i))$
- By convention, we define $\gcd(\emptyset) = \infty$ 
- An MC with period $1$ is called **aperiodic**
- An irreducible MC with period $> 1$ is called **periodic**
## Periodicity & Communication
- If two states $i$, $j$, communicate, they have the same period
- Every state in an irreducible Markov Chain has the same period
- In this case, this is the period of the Markov Chain
### Consequences
- Let $(X_n)_{n = 0}^\infty$ be an irreducible MC with the period $d$
- Then, for every two states $i, j$, there exists $m$ and $n_0$, such that: 
$$\forall n \ge n_0, \Pi^{n * d + m}(i, j) > 0$$
- If a MC is irreducible, aperiodic and the state space is finite, then $\exists n_0$ s.t $\forall n > n_0$ and $\forall i, j$, $\Pi^n (i, i) >0$
