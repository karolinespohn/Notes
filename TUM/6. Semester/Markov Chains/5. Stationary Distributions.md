# Stationary Distribution
- A probability measure $\alpha$ is stationary for a MC on $E$ with transition matrix $\Pi$ if
$$\forall \quad i \in E: \quad \sum_{j \in E} \alpha(j) \Pi(j, i) = \alpha(i)$$
- In matrix notation, this can be written as:
$$\alpha \Pi = \alpha \quad \text{where} \quad \alpha = (\alpha(j))_{j \in E}$$
- If $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb N_0}$ has a stationary initial distribution $\alpha$, then $\forall n \in \mathbb N_0$ and $\forall A \subseteq E$:
$$P_\alpha(X_n \in A) = \alpha(A)$$
## Finding Stationary distributions
- To find stationary distributions, solve the linear system of (possibly infinitely many) equations: 
$$ \begin{cases} \alpha \Pi = \alpha,\quad \alpha(\alpha(i))_{i \in E} \quad \Pi \in [0, 1]^{E \times E}\\ \sum_{i \in E} \alpha(i) = 1 \end{cases} $$
- This system either has no solutions, one solution ot infinitely many solutions
# Reversibility
- Let $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb N_0}$ be a MC on $E$ with the transition matrix $\Pi$
- A measure on $E$ is **reversible** if:
$$\alpha(i)\Pi(i,j) = \alpha(j)\Pi(j, i) \quad \forall i, j \in E$$
- The MC is reversible, if $\Pi$ admits a reversible measure
- Every reversible distribution is stationary
