# Center of Data
- Common ways to measure the center of a distribution include: 
	- **Average**: Also called empirical mean or sample mean of $n$ observed samples
$$\overline x= \frac{\sum_{i = 0}^n x_i}{n}$$
	- **Median**: describes the point at the center of a dataset (or the average of 2 points, if 2 are at the center)
# Variablity
- The **empirical variance** of a sample is the average squared deviation from the mean of a sample: 
$$s_{x,n}^2 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})}{n-1}$$
- The **empirical standard deviation** $s_{x,n}$ is defined as $\sqrt{s_{x,n}^2}$
# Percentiles
- The $k$th **percentile** refers to a number with at least $k$% of observations below/equal to that number and $100-k$% of data above that number
- The **interquartile range (IQR)** is the range between the $75$th and $25$th percentile; $50$% of all observations are in that range
- **Whiskers** in a boxplot are the lines reaching outside the IQR
- **Outliers** are points $> 1.5$ times the IQR away from the first or third quartile
# Robust statistics
- For skewed statistics, median and IQR make a data analysis les susceptible to being affected by outliers. 
# Correlation
- The **empirical correlation** is measures by: 
$$\frac{s_{xy,n}}{s_{x,n}s_{y,n}}$$
