# Definitions

## Variables
### Types
- Variables can be **numerical** or **categorical**
- For categorical variables, we can further distinguish between:
	- **Ordinal variables**: The categories have a natural ordering (e.g: months)
	- **Nominal variables**: The categories don't have a natural order (e.g: gender)
### Relationships
- Variables can be either **associated** or **independent**
- If variable $A$ causally affects variable $B$, $A$ is called an **explanatory variable** and $B$ is called a **response variable**
## Samples
- If an entire population is sampled, this is called a **census**
- If a sample is selected, and some attibutes about that sample are explored, this is called an **experimental analysis**
- **Inference** can be done, if the sample is representative of the group that inference is applied to
### Sampling Strategies
- **Simple random sampling**: Randomly select the sample
- **Stratified sampling**: The population is split into strata (groups with something in common), and samples are randomly drawn from each of the strata
- **Cluster sampling**: A simple random sample of clusters is taken, then each observation in that cluster is taken
- **Multistage sampling**: First, a simple random sample of clusters is taken, then a simple random sample of obseravtions from that cluster are taken. 

### Biases
- In sampling, different biases may occur: 
- **Non-response bias** occurs if only a small part of the sampled population responds
- **Voluntary-response bias** occurs if the sample consists of people who volunteered and are thus likely more interested in the topic than most
- **Convenience-sample bias** refers to people who are more readily available being more likely to be sampled
## Experiments
- If researchers collect data without interfering with how the data is generated, this is called an **observational study**
- If researchers assign subjects to different treatments to find how these treatments affect the data, this is an **experiment**
- If experimental units are not aware of whether they are in the control group or in the treatment group, they have been **blinded**
- If neither experimental units, nor researchers know, who is in which group, this is called **double-blinding**
- Conditions imposed on a subject are called **treatment variables**
- Characteristics of a subject that affect the response variable, and should be controlled for are called **blocking variables**
### Principles
- A **control group** is compared to the treatment group
- Subjects are **randomly** assigned to the different condition
- Experiments should be **replicated** before their results are accepted to be true
- Subjects should be grouped based on **blocking variables**, before randomly assigning the subjects from each cluster to a condition
