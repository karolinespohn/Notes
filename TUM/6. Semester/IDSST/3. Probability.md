# Definitions & Rules
- A **linear combination** of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is a weighted sum: 
$$aX + bY$$
- Mean is a linear operation, so this holds: 
$$\text{mean}(X + Y) = \text{mean}(X) + \text{mean}(Y)$$
- The following rules apply to variance: 
$$\Var[aX] = a^2 \cdot \Var[X]$$
$$\Var[a + X] = \Var[X]$$
$$\Var[aX+bY] = a^2\cdot \Var[X] + 2ab \cdot \Cov[X, Y ]+ b^2\cdot \Var[Y]$$
- The **covariance** of two variables is defined like so: 
$$\Cov[X,Y]=\E[X \cdot Y]-\E[X] \cdot \E[Y]$$
- Two variables $X$ and $Y$ are **uncorrelated** if and only if: 
$$\Cov[X,Y]=0$$
 - The **correlation** between two variables $X$ and $Y$ can be calculated like so: 
$$\Corr[X,Y]=\frac{\Cov[X,Y]}{\sqrt{\Var[X]} \cdot \sqrt{\Var[Y]}} \in [-1, 1]$$
# Hypothesis Testing
- A null-hypothesis $H_0$ is created, reflecting the default state of affairs - the alternative is the unusual state
- Under the assumption that $H_0$ is true, a test $T(\mathbf x)$ is conducted
- If the tests show that there is convincing evidence that $H_0$ is false, it can be rejected
