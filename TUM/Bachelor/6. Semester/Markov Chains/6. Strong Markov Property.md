# Reminder: Weak Markov Property
- The **weak Markov Property** states: 
	- Let $(X_n)$ be a MC with the initial distribution $\mu$ and the transition matrix $\Pi$, let $m\in \mathbb N$ and $k\in E$ such that $P(X_m = k)>0$ 
	- Furthermore, define $Y_n :=X_{m + n}$
	- Then conditioned on the event $\{X_m = k\}$, $(Y_n)$ is a Markov chain with the transition matrix $\Pi$ and initial distribution $\delta_k$, and $(Y_n)$ is independent of $(X_i)_{i=0}^m$
# Strong Markov Property
- For the weak Markov Property, we choose a fixed point in time and require that any future evolution of the process depends only on the state at this point
- For the **strong Markov Property**, we extend this to allow the Markov chain to "hold" at **random stopping times**
## Filtrations
- Let $(\Omega, \F, P)$ be a probability space, and let $(\F_n)$ be a sequence of $\sigma-$[[2. Kontinuierliche Wahrscheinlickeitsraeume|Algebras]] on $\Omega$
- $(\F_n)$ is called a **filtration** if $\forall n: \F_n \subseteq F_{n + 1} \subseteq \F$
- For a stochastic process $(X_n)$, the **natural filtration** is defined as: 
$$\mathcal F_n= \sigma(X_0,X_1,..,X_n) $$
## Stopping Time
- A random variable $\tau$ taking values in $\mathbb N \cup \{\infty\}$ is called a **stopping time** with respect to a filtration $(F_n)$, if: 
$$\forall\; n\in \mathbb N: \, \{\tau \le n\}\in F_n$$
- Intuitively, this means that the decision whether to stop at $n$ is **based on the information available at this point**, not on any future information
	A real life example is, that it never rains in the eastern Mediterranean in the summer. Every spring, there is a "last rain" and every autumn there is a "first rain". The first rain is a stopping point - on that day in autumn when it rains for the first time, it is clear that this is the first rain. The last rain is not a stopping point. On the last day it rains, it is not apparent whether it will still rain the next days.
### Stopped Markov Chain
- Let $(X_n)$ be a Markov Chain with the transition matrix $\Pi$ and let $\tau$ be a stopping time with regards to the natural filtration $(F_n)$ of $(X_n)$
- The stopped Markov chain $X_{n \land \tau} = \begin{cases}X_n \quad \text{if } n \le \tau \\ X_\tau \quad \text{if } \tau \ge n\end{cases}$
## Strong Markov Property
- Let $(X_n)$ be a Markov Chain and let $\tau$ be a stopping time with regards to the natural filtration $(F_n)$ of $(X_n)$ and let $k\in E$
- Assume further that $\Pr[\tau < \infty, x_{\tau} = k] >0$ 
- Define $Y_n = X_{\tau + n}$ and if $\tau = \infty$, let $Y_n$ be chosen arbitrarily
- If $\{\tau < \infty, x_\tau = k\}$< then $Y_n$ is a Markov Chain with the transition matrix $\Pi$ and the initial distribution $\delta_k$, indepedent of $\tau$ and $(X_{n\land \tau})$
