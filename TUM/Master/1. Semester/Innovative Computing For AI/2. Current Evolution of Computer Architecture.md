# Memory as a Bottleneck
- Memory is one of the main limiting factors for compute
- Memory is area hungry - increasing memory does not scale well
- To store one bit, $\ge 6$ bits are needed
- Decreasing the area requirements for the same memory is difficult: Smaller area leads to less stable memory (electrons jump)
# Performance Improvement Wall for Chips
- CISC (common in past) uses complex instructions, RISC (common now) more reduced ones
- RISC is more enegy efficient $\to$ more useful for embedded systems
- Work can not be infinitely parallelized $\to$ increasing cores infinitely doesn't help, we are limited by sequential part
- For mobile devices, running too many cores at ones leads to heat
