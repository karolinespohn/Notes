# Basics Of Social Choice Functions
- Let...
	- ...$N = \{1, ..., n\}$ be a finite set of voters
	- ...$\mathcal W$ be the set of all transotove and complete relations over $U$
- The **domain of admissible preference profiles** $\mathcal D = \mathcal W^N$
- A **social choice function** (SCF) if a function: 
$$f: \mathcal F \times \mathcal D \to 2^U\setminus \{\emptyset\} \quad \text{such that} \quad f(A, P) \subseteq A$$
- Where...
	- ...$A$ is a set of all feasible alternatives
	-  ...$P$ is preference profile, listing all the individual preferences of all voters
- If all the voters preferences are fixed, a social choice function is equivalent to a **choice function** $f(\cdot, P)$
- A SCF is **rationalizable/consistent** if the choice function $f(\cdot, P)$ is rationalizable for each $P\in \mathcal D$
- A SCF is **trivial** if $f(A, P) = A$
- A SCF $f$ is a **refinement** of another SCF. if $f \subseteq f'$
	- A **finer** rule $f$ is more selective than a **coarser** rule $f'$
# Anonymity
- Given two preference profiles $P, P'$, where there exists a bijection $\pi: N_P \to N_{P'}$
- That means, the same preference ballots are included in a different order
- An SCF $f$ is **anonymous** if $f(A, P) = f(A, P')$
- All **voters are treated equally** and renaming voters does not change the outcome
# Neutrality
- Given preference profiles $A, B, P, P'$ with $N_P = N_{P'}$ where ther is a bijection $\pi: A \to B$, with $x \succsim_i y \Leftrightarrow \pi(x) \succsim_o' \pi(y)$
- An SCF is **neurtal**, if $f(B, P') = \{\pi(x): x \in f(A, P)\}$
- All **alternatives are treated equally**, and when alternatives are renamed, winners are also renamed
# Pareto Optimality
- Given $P$ and $x, y \in U$, $x$ **pareto-dominates** $y$ if $x \succ_i y$ for all $i \in N_P$
- An option $Y$ is **pareto optimal**, if no other option pareto-dominates it
- The Pareto SCF $PO(A, P)$ returns all pareto-optimal options
# Resoluteness
- An SCF $f$ is resolute if $|f(A, P)| = 1$ for all $A$ an $P$
- It **never results in a tie**
# Monotonicity
- Given $P, P'$ as well as $a \in U$ and $i \in N$ such that for all $j \neq i: \succsim_j = \succsim_j'$ for all $x, y \in U \setminus a$
- Let all preferences remain the same, except for $a$, which becomes more preferable in some preference ballot
- A SCF is **monotonic** if for all $A, a \in f(A, P)$ implies $a \in f(A, P'$)
- If $a$ is chosen, then it is also chosen when it is reinforced
- A monotonic SCF $f$ is **positively responsive** if given a tie, $a$ wins if it gets a reinforcement
