# Individual Choice
- Let $U$ be a universe of $m\ge 2$ alternatives
- Let $\mathcal F$ be a set of all **feasible** (finite & non-empty) subsets of $U$
- e.g: 
$$U = \{a, b, c\}$$
$$\mathcal F = \{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{b, c\}, \{a, b, c\}\}$$
- A **choice function** is a function $f: \mathcal F \to 2^U\setminus\{\emptyset\}$, such that $f(A) \subseteq A$ for all $A$ in $\mathcal F$  
# Preference
- $a \succsim b$ means, $a$ is at least as good as $b$. $a$ weakly dominates $b$
	- It is assumed to be **complete** meaning $\forall a, b \in A$:  $a \succsim$ b or $b \succsim a$
- $a \succ  b$ means $a$ is **strictly preferable** to $b$
- $a \sim b$ refers to **indifference** between the alternatives
# Maximality
- The **maximal set** for a preference relation $\succsim$ and a feasible set $A \in \mathcal F$ contains the best elements of $A$ according to $\succsim$ and it is defined like so: 
$$Max(A, \succsim) = \{ x \in A: y\succ x \text{ for no } y \in A\}$$
- Since $\succsim$ is complete, this implies: 
$$Max(A, \succsim) = \{ x \in A: x \succsim y \text{ for all } y \in A\}$$
- Binary relations are **transitive** ($x\succsim y \land y \succsim z \to x\succsim z$) **quasi transitive** ($x\succ y \land y \succ z \to x\succ z$) and acyclic ($x \succ y \succ... \succ z \to \neg (z \succ x)$)
- $\forall A \in \mathcal F: Max(A, \succsim) \neq \emptyset$ for all  $A \in \mathcal F$ if $\succsim$ is acylcic
- $f$ is rationalizable, if there exists a binary relation $\succsim$ on $U$ such that $f(A) = \text{Max}(A, \succsim)$ for all A
# Transitive Rationalizability
- Let $A, B \in \mathcal F$,  let $B \subseteq A$ and let $f(A) \cup B  \neq \emptyset$
- That means, we have a bigger set of alternatives $A$ and a smaller set of alternatives $B$
- $f(X)$ refers to all alternatives chosen from set $X$ (the winners)
## Contraction
- **Contraction** is given if: 
$$f(B) \supseteq f(A) \cap B$$
- Where...
	- ...$f(B)$ are the winners from the smaller set
	- ...$f(A)$ are the winners from the larger set
	- ...$f(A) \cap B$ are the winners from $A$ that are still available in $B$
	- ...$f(B) \supseteq f(A) \cap B$ means, that any winner in $A$ that is in $B$ must still be a winner in $B$
- If an item is a winner in the bigger set, it must also be a winner in the smaller set containing the item
## Expansion
- **Expansion** is given if: 
$$\forall X, Y \in \mathcal F: \quad f(X) \cap f(Y) \subseteq f (X \cup Y)$$
- If an item is a winner in both of two smaller sets, it is also a winner in the union of the two sets
## Strong Expansion
- **Strong expansion** is given if: 
$$f(B) \subseteq f(A) \cap B$$
- Where...
	- ...$f(B)$ are the winners from the smaller set
	- ...$f(A)$ are the winners from the larger set
	- ...$f(A) \cap B$ are the winners from $A$ that are still available in $B$
	- ...$f(B) \subseteq f(A) \cap B$ means, that any loser in $A$ that is in $B$ must still be a loser in $B$
- If an item is a loser in the bigger set, it must also be a loser in the smaller set containing the item
## Week Axiom Of revealed preferences
- The **weak axiom of revealed preference (WARP)** is fulfilled if contraction and strong expansion hold
$$f(B) = f(A) \cap B$$
- If WARP is fulfilled, the choice function is called **rationalizable by transitive relation**
