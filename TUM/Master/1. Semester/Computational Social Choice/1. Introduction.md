# Voting 
## Rules
- **Plurality**  means choosing the alternative ranked first by most voters
	- Does not guarantee majority supports this alternative
- **Borda's Rule** is a rule where the lowest-ranked alternative gets 0 points, the second lowest gets 1 point, ..., and the alternative with most points wins
- **Plurality with runoff** refers to a plurality system, where the two most popular alternatives are subjected to another vote, if no alternative has majority approval 
- **Instant-runoff** is a procedure where the alternative with the lowest amount of votes for first place is repeatedly eliminated
	- All votes for that alternative are deleted and votes for alternatives ranked than the eliminated alternative are incremented by one
- **Nanson's Rule** is a system where all alternatives with Borda scores below average are removed, the scores are recomputed and the procedure is repeated
## Desirable Properties
- **No majority loosers**: Alternatives ranked last by the majority should not win
- **No manipulation**: Voters should not benefit from lying about their preferences
- **No strategic abstention**: Voters should not benefit from abstaining from an election
