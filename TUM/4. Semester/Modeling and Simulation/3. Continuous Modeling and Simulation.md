# Pupulation dynamics
- We consider the **population growth** of a species $P$ 
- The constants for **birth** and **death rate** per unit of time and per individual are denoted by $\gamma$ and $\delta$ respectiviely
- The resulting **growth rate** is
$$\lambda = \gamma - \delta $$
- For $p(t)$ being the number of individuals in $P$ 
## Refinements
### Linear Growth
- It is not reasonable for a population to have lasting exponential growth
- A possible solution is to consider linear birth and death rates instead of exponential ones:
$$\gamma(t) = \gamma_0-\gamma_1p(t)$$
$$\delta(t) = \delta_0+\delta_1(t)$$
### Logistic Growth
- Linear growth rarely makes sense when considering population growth 
- A function is defined as follows, with $a >> b$
$$p(t) = \frac{a \cdot p_0}{b \cdot p_0 + (a - b \cdot p_0) \cdot e^{-at}}$$
- The function converges:
$$\lim_{t \to \infty} p(t) = \frac ab $$
- If $p_0 < \frac ab$, an inflection point exists, otherwisethe function will decrease monotonically
- External factors are not considered
### Oscillations
- Especially when considering two species $P$ and $Q$, oscillations may occur 
- $P$ and $Q$ can either compete, have a predator-prey relationship or be in symbiosis
## Numerical Treatment of ODEs
- In numerical calculations, **rounding errors**, **truncation errors** and **input data errors** may occur
- For more information see [[5. Differenzialgleichungen|my notes from last semester]]
- Take a look at Euler's method, and the terms consistency and convergence
