# Population dynamics
- Population of a species can either be modeled by looking at the species in isolation, or by regarding multiple species
## Model of Mathuls
- We consider the **population growth** of a species $P$ 
- The constants for **birth** and **death rate** per unit of time and per individual are denoted by $\gamma$ and $\delta$ respectiviely
- The resulting **growth rate** is
$$\lambda = \gamma - \delta $$
- The population of $P$ at a time $t$ is described by the following function:
$$p(t + \Delta t ) = p(t) + (\gamma -\delta ) \cdot p(t) \cdot \Delta t$$
- From this, we derive an [[5. Differenzialgleichungen|ODE]] with the solution
$$p(t) = p_0 \cdot e^{(\lambda - \delta)t}$$
## Refinements
### Saturation by Verhulst
- It is not reasonable for a population to have lasting exponential growth
- A possible solution is to consider linear birth and death rates instead of exponential ones:
$$\gamma(t) = \gamma_0-\gamma_1p(t)$$
$$\delta(t) = \delta_0+\delta_1(t)$$
- From this, we derive the following differential equation:
$$\dot{p}(t) = \gamma(t) - \delta(t) = \gamma_0 - \delta_0 - (\gamma_1 + \delta_1) \cdot p(t)$$
- The solution is:
$$p(t) = \frac{\gamma_0 - \delta_0}{\gamma_1 + \delta_1} + \left(p_0 - \frac{\gamma_0 - \delta_0}{\gamma_1 + \delta_1} \right) \cdot e^{-m \cdot t}$$
### Logistic Growth
- In Verhulst's model, birth and death rate decline at the start of the population growth, which is unrealistiv
 - In better models, the population growth begins to shrink starting at an **inflection** point
## Multiple Species
- When considering multiple species $P$ and $Q$, the growth of one species may be influenced by the other
- It is described with the following equations:
$$\dot{p}(t) = f(p(t), q(t)) \cdot p(t)$$
$$\dot{q}(t) = g(p(t), q(t)) \cdot q(t)$$
- The impact of the size of the population $p$ and $q$ on the growth rates $f$ and $q$ can be described by the derivatives of $f$ with regards to $p$ and $q$
### Equilibrium
- An equilibrium $(\overline p, \overline q)$ is reached, when $f(\overline p, \overline q) = 0$ and $f(\overline p, \overline q) = 0$ 
- An equilibrium can be found by constructing linear equations from $f = 0$ and $g = 0$
#### Attractiveness
- **Attractive equilibriums** are points, that will be reached at some point in yime
- To determine whether an equilibrium is attractive, we regard Jacobian of the following matrix:
$$F(p, q) = \begin{pmatrix}
f(p, q) \cdot p \\
g(p, q) \cdot q \\
\end{pmatrix}$$
- If the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of $F(\overline p, \overline q)$ are **negative** $(\overline p, \overline q)$ is attractive
#### Stability
- If an equilibrium is stable, the growth rates oscillate around the equilibrium
### Different relationships
- Species have different relationships toward one another
#### Competition
- The impact of the species on their growth rates can be described with:
$$f_p, f_q, g_p, g_q < 0$$
- A larger population of any species slows down the growth rate of every species
- If a species competes as much with itself as it does with others, a species is either only reached if one species goes extinct, or in every state
#### Predator-Prey
- If $p$ is a predator and $q$ is prey, the growth rate can be described as follows:
 $$f_p, g_p, g_q < 0, \; \; f_q > 0$$
- Each species competes with itself, more predators lead to slower growth of the prey population and more prey leads to faster growth of the predator population

## Numerical Treatment of ODEs
- In numerical calculations, **rounding errors**, **truncation errors** and **input data errors** may occur
- For more information see [[5. Differenzialgleichungen|my notes from last semester]]
- Take a look at Euler's method, and the terms consistency and convergence
# Control Engineering
- Running technical processes consists of **planning**, **non-feedback control** and **feedback control**
- Non-feedback control refers to adjusting control variables based on longer term knowledge rather than current measurments
- Feedback control refers to adjusting control variables based on actual measurements
## Feedback Control
- In the **outer control loop** long-term things are measured and a larger deviation is allowed
- In the **inner controll loop**, time-critical things are measured and only small deviations are allowed
- A reference value is compared with the actual value
- A controller determines a control variable which is combied with a distrubance to change the future data
![[feedback control.png|400]]
### Important Controllers
#### P-Controllers
- The control variable is **proportional** to the actual deviation
$$u \sim \Delta y = y_{target} - y_{actual}$$
#### PID-Controllers
- The control variable consists of a **proportional**, an **integral** and a **differential** element
- The integral element guarantees that $\Delta y \to 0$
- The differential element considers **changes in the reference value deviation**
## Fuzzy Logic
- A **crisp set** $X$ is a set for which it is clearly defined which $x \in X$ and which $x' \not \in X$ 
- A **fuzzy set** $\tilde A$ over $X$ is a set where it is not immediately clear which elements are in and which elements are out
- A **membership function** $\mu$ is defined to determine which for every $x \in X$ state a degree to which it belongs to the fuzzy set

![[membership functions.png]]
### Operations with Fuzzy Sets
- The **intersection** $\tilde{C} = \tilde A \cap \tilde B$ is defined by 
$$\mu(x, X, \tilde C) = \min\{\mu(x, X, \tilde A), \mu(x, X, \tilde B\}$$
- The **union** $\tilde C = \tilde A \cup \tilde B$ is defined by
$$\mu(x, X, \tilde C) = \max\{\mu(x, X, \tilde A), \mu(x, X, \tilde B\}$$
 - The **complement** $\tilde C = \overline{\tilde A}$ is defined by
$$\mu(x, X, \tilde C) = 1-\mu(x, X, \tilde A)$$

### Linguistic Variables
- A **linguistic variable** (e.g: "temperature") has an associated crisp set $X$ 
- The set of values of $v$ is calles **term set** $T(v)$ 
- A l**inguistic term** (e.g: "hot")is a fuzzy set defined over the crisp set $X$
### Fuzzy Control Systems
- Oftentimes processes can't be modelled well mathematically with reasonable complexity
- Fuzzy controll systems are easily understood and intuitive
#### Structure
##### Step 1: Fuzzification
- In **fuzzification**, linguistic variables and their assigned terms and membership functions are defined
- When a concrete value is measured, membership values for the linguistic terms have to be determined
##### Step 2: Rule Base
- A **rule base** is created based on expert knowledge
- Elementary rules of the following form are constructed:
$$\text{IF } X_1 = \tilde A_{1, j} \text{ AND } X_2 = \tilde A_{2, j} \text{ THEN } Y= \tilde B_j$$
##### Step 3: Inference
- **Inference operators** are defined, through which the fuzziness is transfered from the measured variables to the control variables)
- For each left side of a rule, a $\mu_j$ can be calculated, which limits the membership degree of the fuzzy set $B_j$ 
- For a value $x \in X$, and the degree of membership $\mu(x, X, \tilde A)$ and each elementary condition $X = \tilde A$:
	- The values 
##### Step 5: Defuzzification
- **Defuzzification** is the calculation of crisp contorl variables
- For each linguistic vriable in the THEN-part of the rule, all respective rules have to be considered
# Heat Equation (from [Anton](https://github.com/AntonScheitler/Notes))
- The equation, which describes transfer of heat is:
$$\kappa \cdot \Delta T = T_t$$
$$\Delta T = T_{xx} + T_{yy} + T_{zz}$$
- Here, $T_s$ refers to the derivative of $T$ with respect to a variable $s$
## Types of PDEs
- The heat equation is a linear PDE of second order, because the equation consists of a linear combinations of the function itself, its first and its second derivative
### Classification
- The following holds for the heat equation:
$$\kappa \cdot T_{xx} + \kappa \cdot T_{yy} + \kappa \cdot T_{zz} - T_t = 0$$
- The coefficients of the second derivatives $T_{ss}$ can therefore be written as a matrix, those of the first derivative as a vector:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
\kappa & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \kappa & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \kappa & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}, \; b = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
-1 \\
\end{pmatrix}$$
- Since one of the eigenvalues of $A$ is $0$ and the others have the same sign, this is a parabolic PDE
- Classifying PDEs is important, since each class requires a different numerical approach
## Finite Differences Method
- The finite differences method is used to approximate all occuring derivatives in a differential equation
### Approach
- A domain is made discrete by defining a set of points on a mesh
- Each section of the mesh has a number of widths $h = (h_x, h_y, h_z)$
- The first derivatives of a differential equation can be approximated using difference quotients:
$$\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}(\xi) = \frac{u(\xi + h_x) - u(\xi)}{h_x}$$
- The second derivatives can be approximated using a 3-point-stencil:
$$\frac{\delta^2u}{\delta^2x^2} = \frac{u(\xi + h_x) - 2u(\xi) + u(\xi - h_x)}{h_x^2}$$
- Since the boundary of the mesh is given by the initial and boundary conditions of a problem, the mesh points can be calculated one by one
