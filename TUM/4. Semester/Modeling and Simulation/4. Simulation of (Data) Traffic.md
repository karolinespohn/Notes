# Data Traffic in Computing Systems
- The aim is to model and simulate traffic of data packages through networks consisting of different service units
- The data package flow is modelled using **queuing networks**, in wheich packages wait for a service unit to become available
- For unpredictable events, stochastics are used
## Stochastics 
- Most of the tools used in the modelling of data traffic are described [[2. Kontinuierliche Wahrscheinlickeitsraeume|here]]
- The term **hazard rate** of a random variable $T$ is given by: 
$$h_T(t) = \frac{f_T(t)}{1 - F_T(t)}$$
- For a uniformly distributed $T$, the hazard rate is $\frac 1{a-t}$, meaning if an event hasn't occured up until the point $t$, it is more likely to occur with a growing $t$
- For a [[1.4. Wichtige Diskrete Verteilungen|poisson distributed]] $T$, the hazard rate is constants
## Little's Law
- The **dwelling time** $y$ is the total time a job spends in a service unit
- The **throughput** $d$ is the average number of jobs completed in a given time interval
- The **filling** $f$ is the amount of jobs in a system
- The following relation holds: 
$$E(F) = E(D) \cdot E(F)$$
## Elementary Queuing System
- In a queuing system, jobs cannot be lost
- Jobs wait in a canal before while the SU is occupied
- Elementary queuing systems consist of only one canal with capacity $k_{WP}$ and only one service unit with capacity $k_U$
## Modeling of Job Processing in Queuing System
- To model incoming jobs, stochastics are necessary
