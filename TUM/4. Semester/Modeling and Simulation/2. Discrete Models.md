# Decision Models
- Decision models are used to describe the decisions of a party trying to maximize an outcome under certain circumstances
- Decision models are designed for a **decision marker/player** $S$, $m$ possible **actions/strategies** $A_1,...A_m$, $n$ possible initial states $s_1,...,s_n$, a **payoff/rating** $N_{ij} \in \mathbb R$ for an action $A_i$ in state $s_j$ and a payoff matrix 
$$N = (N_{ij})_{1 \le i \le m, 1 \le j \le n}$$
## Generic Decision Models
- Decisions can be made considering **certainty**, **risk** or **uncertainty**
### Strategies under Certainty
- Under **certainty about the initial state**, you choose the best option:
$$\hat i \in \{1,...,m\} \,\text{ with }\, N_{\hat ij} = \max_i N_{ij}$$
### Strategies under Risk
- Under **risk**, there is some uncertainty about the state
- **Cautious** approaches the action resulting in the **best possible outcome** for the **worst possible state** is chosen
$$N_{\hat i j_{\hat i}} = \max_i \min_j N_{ij}$$
- **Full Risk** approaches choose the action resulting in the **best outcome** for the **best possible state**
$$N_{\hat i j_{\hat i}} = \max_i \max_j N_{ij}$$
- **Alternative Caution** approaches choose the action resulting in the **best outcome** for the state with the greatest difference in payoffs 
$$R_{\hat ij_{\hat i}}= \min_i \max_j R_{ij} $$
## Two-Player Zero-Sum Game
- Given a **win player** $S_1$ with $m$ possible actions $A_1,...,A_m$ and a **loss player** $S_2$ with $n$ possible actions $B_1,...,B_n$ 
- The **assesment** if $S_1$ chooses $A_1$ and $S_2$ chooses $A_2$ is denoted by $a_{ij}$ and refers to the **payoff** from $S_2$ to $S_1$
- The **loss player** aims to minimize $a_{i,j}$ and the win player aims to maximize it
- $S_1$ assumes that $S_2$ will take the option which minimizes $a_{ij}$ and choose the action maximizing $a_{ij}$ in this case
- $S_2$ assumes that $S_3$ will take the option which maximizes $a_{ij}$ and choose the action minimizing $a_{ij}$ in this case
- Players may reach an **equilibrium** where loss is minimizes and win is maximized
- In that case, neither player would benefit from changing strategies
## Group Decision Making
- For a set of options $A$, a ranking is defined: 
$$r: A \to \mathbb N$$
- It is used to describe a **preference relation** $\varrho$ on $A$
$$x\varrho y :r(x) < r(y) $$
### Collective Choice Function
- Each voter defines a preference relation $P_A$ based on their ranking of the options
- Collective choice functions consider each individual's $P_A$ to create a total $P_A$
$$K : P_A^n = P_A \times P_A \times ...\times P_A \to P_A$$
#### Rank Addition
- For each candidate, their rank from each voters ranking are summed up 
- The winner is the candidate with the lowest ranking
### Democracies
- In a democracy, the **5 democratic basic rules** should hold
	1. $K$ must be defined for all of $P_A^n$
	2. $K$ must lie in $P_A$
	3. **Pareto**: The entirety can enforce any desired ranking $\varrho$ through unanimity
$$(\forall i \in \{1,...,n\}: x\varrho_iy)\implies x\varrho y$$
	4.  **Independance of irrelevant alternatives**: Identical rankings regarding $x$ and $y$ yield the same collective ranking regarding $x$ and $y$
	5. **Exclusion of a dictator**: no voter can always prevail
- In most systems, at least one vore doesn't hold
# Scheduling
- Given a process consisting of $n$ tasks $A_1,...,A_n$, processed on $m$ machines $M_1,...M_m$
- $t_i^{(j)}$ describes the **execution time** for task $A_i$ on machine $M_j$
- Each task can be carried out by **only one machine** at a time and each machine can do **only one task** at a time
- A **precedence condition** $A_i \to A_j$ implies that $A_j$ can only start once $A_i$ has finished 
- A schedule assigns a **start time**  $s_i$ to each task $i$, that is valid according to all precedence conditions
## Precedence Graphs
- In precedence graphs, the earliest start and times are written at the top of each node and the latest start and finish time are written at the bottom

## Job Shop
- In the Job Shop Models, tasks $A_1,...,A_n$ are broken down into **subtasks** $A_{i, 1},..., A_{i,m}$
- The subtasks of each tasks are processed sequentially, with task $A_{i, j}$ finishing before task $A_{i, j +1}$, but the tasks $A_i$ and $A_{i + 1}$ can be scheduled independently
- Each subjob requires a machine, and each job requires each machine only once
### Open Shop
- Similar to job shop, but subjobs can be arbitraryly permuted between machines
### Flow Shop
- Similar to job shop, but subjobs pass through machines in the same order
### Disjunctive Edges
- If two tasks cannot be scheduled at the same time, (i.e $A_i$ has to be scheduled before $A_j$ or $A_j$ has to be scheduled before $A_i$), **disjunctive edges** can be used
- An edge $E_1 = (A_i, A_j)$ and an edge $E_2 = (A_j, A_i)$ are added, but in each "execution" of the schedule, only one edge is chosen
- All other edges are called **conjunctive**
- To optimize a job shop schedule, the choice of which disjunctive edge to take is sometimes relevant
