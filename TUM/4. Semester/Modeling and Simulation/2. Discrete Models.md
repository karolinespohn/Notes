- Decisions can be made considering **certainty**, **risk** or **uncertainty**
# Decision Models
- Decision models are designed for a **decision marker/player** $S$, $m$ possible **actions/strategies** $A_1,...A_m$, $n$ possible initial states $s_1,...,s_n$, a **payoff/rating** $N_{ij} \in \mathbb R$ for an action $A_i$ in state $s_j$ and a payoff matrix 
$$N = (N_{ij})_{1 \le i \le m, 1 \le j \le n}$$
## Strategies under Certainty
- Under **certainty about the initial state**, you choose the best option:
$$\hat i \in \{1,...,m\} \,\text{ with }\, N_{\hat ij} = \max_i N_{ij}$$
# Strategies under Risk
## Caution
- The **minimal possible payoff** (the state with the worst $j$) is maximized over all possible strategies $i$
$$N_{\hat i j_{\hat i}} = \max_i \min_j N_{ij}$$
## Full Risk
- The **maximal possible payoff** is maximized over all possible strategies $i$
$$N_{\hat i j_{\hat i}} = \max_i \max_j N_{ij}$$
## Alternative Caution
- Let $N_j = \max_iN_{ij}$ be the maximal payoff with state $J$ and $R_{ij} = N_j-N_{ij}$ be the risk at action $i$ with state $j$
- Choose the strategy with
$$R_{\hat ij_{\hat i}}= \min_i \max_j R_{ij} $$
# Two-Player Zero-Sum Game
- Given a **win player** $S_1$ with $m$ possible actions $A_1,...,A_m$ and a **loss player** $S_2$ with $n$ possible actions $B_1,...,B_n$ 
- The **assesment** if $S_1$ chooses $A_1$ and $S_2$ chooses $A_2$ is denoted by $a_{ij}$ and refers to the **payoff** from $S_2$ to $S_1$
- If each turn the players alternate, the strategy:
$$S_1: A_i \implies S_2 : B_{j_i},\, a_{i, j_i} = \min_j a_{ij}$$
$$S_2: B_j \implies S_1 : A_{i_j},\, a_{j, i_j} = \max a_{ij}$$
## Simultaneous Action
- If both players act  simulteneously and cautiously $S_1$ would try to maximize their winnings while $S_2$ would try to minimize their loss
$$S_1: \text{ choose }\,\hat i \, \text{ with } \, a_{\hat i j_{\hat i}} = \max_i\min_ja_{ij}$$$$S_2: \text{ choose }\,\hat j \, \text{ with } \, a_{i_{\hat j}, \hat j} = \min_j \max_i a_{ij}$$
# Group Decision Making
## Collective Choice Function
- A decision of $n$ individuals' preferences can be determined as follows:
$$K : P_A^n = P_A \times P_A \times ...\times P_A \to P_A$$ 
- $K$ must be **total** on $P_A^n$, i.e. defined on the whole $P_A^n$ 
- The result of $K$ must again be a relation in $P_A$

# Scheduling
- Given a process consisting of $n$ tasks $A_1,...,A_n$, processed on $m$ machines $M_1,...M_m$
- $t_i^{(j)}$ describes the **execution time** for task $A_i$ on machine $M_j$
- Each task can be carried out by **only one machine** at a time and each machine can do **only one task** at a time
- If the machines are **qualitatively** and **quantitatively** identical the machines can do the same tasks and each machine can do the same task in the same time
$$t_i^{(j)} = t_i$$
