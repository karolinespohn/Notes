# Microprocessors, -computers and -controllers
- A **microprocessor** has a kernel containing a control unit and an ALU, as well as registers
![[Microprocessor.png|300]]
- **Microcomputers** contains a microprocessor, as well as memory management, a databus and an I/O interface
![[Microcomputer.png|300]]
- A **microcontroller** is similar to a microcomputer where everything is integrated in one chip

# Embedded Processors
- Embedded processors are processing units that are integrated into systems to perform specific tasks, unlike general-purpose computers
- For example, **DSP** (Digital-Signal-Processors) are optimized for signal processing
- **ASICs** (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) are fully custom hardware design for specific tasks
- Their functionality cannot be changed after manufacturing
- **FGPA**s (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) bridgeÂ the gap between standard hardware (microprocessors/DSPs) and fully custom hardware (ASICs)
- They contain arrays of look-up tables and flip-flops that can be programmed to implement logic functions
# Embedded Systems
- Perform a variety of tasks, ranging from simple control tasks in household appliances to entertainment electronics, communication systems and applications in health care and automotive
- Many possible optimizations such as async IO requests, virtual memory, branching and pipelining cannot be applied to embedded systems to maintain temporal **determinism**
