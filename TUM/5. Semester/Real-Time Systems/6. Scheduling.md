# Temporal Characterization
- A task $T_i$ has an arrival time $a_i$, a start time $s_i$, a finishing time $f_i$, an absolute deadline $d_i$ and a computation time $C_i$ 
![[task times.png|400]]
- The **relative deadline** $D_i$ is given by $D_i = d_i - a_i$
- The **response time** $R_i$ is given by $R_i = f_i -a_i$ 
- The **criticality** refers to whether the deadline is hard, firm or soft
- The **value** denotes the importance of a task
- The **lateness** is given by $L_i = f_i -d_i$
- The **slack time (laxity)** is given by $X_i = d_i -a_i -C_i$
- The **tardiness/exceeding time** is given by $E_i = \max(0, L_i)$
