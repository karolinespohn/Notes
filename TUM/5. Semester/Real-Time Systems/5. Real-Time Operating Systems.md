# Introduction
- The operating system is responsible for **resource management** and it serves as an **extended machine**
- RTS can function without an OS, typically by running a **main loop** and executing **interrupt routines** for time critical code

- However, for better scalability, RTOS separate program segments into individual tasks, which can be executed in parallel

# Threads vs. Processes
- In **multi-threaded applications**, different tasks run on different threads, but share the same address space, allowing for quick context changes
- In the **multi-process model**, each process has its own address space, and context changes are handled by the MMU
- A **compromise** is working with multiple threads, protected by the MMU
# Scheduling
- Through scheduling, processes are given access to system resources
## Types of Schedulers
- **Cooperative/voluntary schedulers** require processes to cooperate with them; The processor cannot be forcably taken from a process
- **Preemptive Schedulers** allow for the processor to be forcably taken from user-space processes
- **Preemptive OS Schedulers** allow for the processor to be forcably taken from user- or kernel-space processes
## Strategies
### Run To Completion (RTC) Scheduler
- Tasks are functions which run until it returns
- State variables can enable returning a task before it returns and picking it up again later
### Round Robin (RR) Scheduler
- Tasks are funcitons
- They can relinquish control by making a call to the RTOS
- Kernel has to save context and load the context of the next task
### Time Slice Scheduler
- Time is divided into slots and tasks run in the slots assigned to them 
- Tasks can relinquish control and the kernel can preempt tasks
- Context saving is necessary
### Priority Scheduler
- Each task has a (dynamic) priority
- The scheduler is run, when an event occurs
