# Types of Systems
- Systems which influence the environment with the use of computers are called **cyber-physical system/real-time system**
- Systems which are embedded in physical processes are called embedded systems
# Correctness
- **Correctness** is determined not only by the result, but also by the time they are delievered
# Deadlines
- A deadline refers to the instant, when a result must be produced
- For **soft deadlines**, the result is still useful even after the deadline has passed
- For **firm deadlines**, the result is no longer useful after the deadline
- For **hard deadlines**, horrible consequences will follow if the result is not delivered
# Time & Event triggered Applications
- In **time triggered applications**, the entire cycle is determined at compile time
- Through static scheduling, the system can achieve deterministic/predictable behavior
- In **event triggered applications**, scheduling is carried out dynamically
