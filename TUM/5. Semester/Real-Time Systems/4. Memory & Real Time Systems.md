# Caches
- Caches are useful because of **temporal** and **spatial locality**
- A cache consists of multiple **slots**
- Slots contain a **valid** bit, a **dirty** bit, a **tag** and the cache lines

- Updated data is either written through directly to memory, or it is only updated when a dirty line is evicted from the cache
- **Write through** is simpler, but it consumes more energy, can be slower and the number of writes is higher
- **Write back** is more complex, but execution time is faster and requires less writes
# SRAM 
- Static RAM requires no refreshes, but after the power is turned off, the memory is no longer held
- It is typically used in caches and on-chip memory
# SDRAM
- Synchronous Dynamic RAM is a memory type synchronized to a clock signal
- Data is stored as charge on internal capacitors
- Refreshes are necessary to counteract the leakage of capacitors
## Architecture 
- SDRAM consists of different **banks**
- Whenever data from a bank is read, the row is copied to the bank's **row buffer**
- It is replaced, if another row from the same bank is read
- Row-buffers are **bidirectional**: both read and write happen there
- Changing direction from read to write or from write to read results in a **penalty**
