# Time measurements
- A **microtick** is the smallest possible measurement of time
- The frequency $f$ is defined by the microticks per second
- The granularity of a watch is $\frac 1f$
## Errors
- Let $z$ be a perfect clock, against which all other clocks will be compared
- The drift of a physical clock $k$ is defined as follows:
$$\text{drift}_i^k= \frac{z(\text{microtick}_{i + 1}^k) - z(\text{microtick}_{i}^k)}{n^k}$$
$$\rho = |\text{drift}_i^k -1|$$
