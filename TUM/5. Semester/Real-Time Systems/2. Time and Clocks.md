# Time Standards
- Different time-standards, such as TAI, UTC and UNIX/POSIX time
- TAI and UNIX time are **chronoscopic**: They ignore leap seconds
- UTC is **non-chronoscopic**: Leap seconds are considered
# Time measurements
- A **microtick** is the smallest possible measurement of time
- The frequency $f$ is defined by the microticks per second
- The granularity of a clock is $\frac 1f$
## Errors
### Drift
- Let $z$ be a perfect clock, against which all other clocks will be compared
- The drift of a physical clock $k$, with $n^k$ microticks between two clockitcks is defined as follows:
$$\text{drift}_i^k= \frac{z(\text{microtick}_{i + 1}^k) - z(\text{microtick}_{i}^k)}{n^k}$$
$$\rho = |\text{drift}_i^k -1|$$
### Counter Error
- Occurs when the clock's counter is inaccurate
- Causes can be faults in silicon and electromagnetic interference
## Ensembles of clocks
- In distributed systems, an ensemble of multiple clocks is used
### Precision
- The **precision**  $\Pi$  denotes the maximum offset of respective microticks of an ensemble of clocks in a duration of interest and measured in microticks of the reference clock
- The **offset** between two clocks is measured by: 
$$\text{offset}_{i}^{k,l}= |z(\text{microtick}_i^k) - z(\text{microtick}_i^l)|$$
- The precision at a specific timestamp is:
$$\Pi _i = \max_{\forall k,l\in nodes}\{\text{offset}_i^{kl}\}$$
- The precision over an interval is defined as:
$$\Pi = \max_{t_1 \le i \le t_2}\left(\max_{\forall k, l \in nodes}\{\text{offset}_i^{kl}\}\right)$$

### Byzantine Errors
- Occur when a component in a distributed system fails arbitrarily, for instance by providing inconsistent information to different parts of the system

### Global Time
- Each $n$-th microtick of a clock can be interpreted as a macrotick to approximate a global time
- A clock is called **reasonable** if $g>\Pi$ 
- The global clock is called reasonable, if the internal synchronization error is less than the duration between two consecutive macroticks
$$|t^k(e) - t^l(e)| \le 1$$
- This way, the timestamps for a single event can only differ by one macrotick
![[events happening close to each other.png|400]]
### Limits
- Time measurements in distributed real-time-systems are subject to 3 limitations: 
	1. The time-stamps of events can differ by up to $1$ tick, whereby the temporal order of events cannot always be reconstrued
	2. The duration $d$ of an event is bounded by $d_{observed}-2g \le d_{true} \le d_{observed} + 2g$
	3. The temporal order of events can be recovered if the difference between their timestamps is $>2g$
### Synchronization
- To keep a clock within a bounded accuracy it must be periodically resynchronized
- This process is called **external synchronization**
- If all clocks of an ensemble are externally synchronized with an accuracy $A$, they are also internally synchronized with an offset $\le 2A$
- **Internal synchronization** ensures that the global ticks of all nodes occur within a specified precision
### Internal Synchronization
####  Central Master Synchronization
- In **Central Master Synchronization**, a **master clock** is used as a reference for client clocks
- The aim is syncing client clocks to match the master clock by accounting for known transmission delays
- The **clock derivation** $\delta t$ is calculated like so: 
$$\delta t=|t_{Master}-(t_{Client} + t_{latency})|$$
- The **convergence function** $\Phi$ determines how closely the locks in a distributed system can be synchronized over time 
- It depends on the transmission times of the fastest and slowest message (=**jitter** $\varepsilon$)
- The precision of synchronization $\Pi_{central}$ depends on the jitter $\varepsilon$ and the drift $\Gamma$
$$\Pi_{central } = \Gamma + \varepsilon$$
- This algorithm is **not fault-tolerant**; if the master clock fails, all clocks fail
#### Fault-Tolerant Algorithms
- Fault tolerant algorithms usually have the following 3 phases: 
	1. Aquire state of global time counters on all clocks
	2. Analyse data & execute convergence function to find correction value
	3. Adjust local time counter
- It is **not possible** to sync clocks of an ensemble of $N$ nodes better than to the precision: $$\Pi = \varepsilon \cdot (1 - \frac 1N)$$
- An example of a **fault-tolerant** algorithm is **Christian's Algorithm**
	- The **cleint** sends a request for the time from the **server**
	- The **server** answers with the time $T$ from its own clock
	- The **client** updates their clock to be: $$T + \frac{t_r}2$$
	![[Christian's Algo.png|200]]
#### State & Rate correction
- The calculated correction term can either be used to do **state** or **rate correction**
- **State correction** corrects the local time immediately, but thereby leads to **discontinuity**
- If the clock is set back, a time value appears twice, if it's set forward, some values may never appear
- **Rate correction** correcst the rate (speed) of the clock, for example by changing the microticks per macrotick
### External Synchronization
- Links the global time of a distributed system to an external time reference
- A designated node of the cluster (**time gateway**) receives time from an external reference
![[external sync.png|400]]
#### Precision Time Protocol
- PTP aims to sync the clocks in a computer network
- It uses a **server/client** architecture and assumes that the transit time from server to client is the same as the transit time from client to server
![[ptp.png||400]]
- The client corrects its clock by $T_{transit} + \Delta T$
#### NTP
- External synchronization protocol to sync clocks to UTC in **packet-switched** and **variable-latency** networks 
- NTP organizes devices in a hierarchical structure based on their distance from the reference clock:
![[ntp.png|400]]
- A higher stratum denotes a higher distance from the reference clock
- NTP uses a $64$ bit timestamp, with $32$ bits for seconds and $32$ bits for fractional seconds
- Clients and servers exchange timestamps with **offsets** and **delay**: 
$$\text{offset} = \theta = \frac{(t_2 -t_1)+(t_3 - t_4)}{2}$$
$$\text{delay} = \delta = (t_4 - t_1)- (t_3 - t_2) $$
![[ntp messages.png|400]]
- The client adjusts its clock gradually based on the calculated offset (using **rate correction**) to avoid sudden jumps in time.
