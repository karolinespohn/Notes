# Requirements
- **Predictability**: Latencies must be deterministic
- **Synchronism**: The variability of a message delivery must be small
- **For fast systems**: Small latencies & guaranteed bandwidths
- **Reliability**: Few faults and fault handling satisfying the conditions above
# Aspects of Communication Protocols
- The ISO/OSI standard provides an abstraction model for communication
- The **physical layer**, **data layer** and **application layer** are the most important for real-time communication
## Physical Layer
- Concerns itself with network topologies, line codes and physical connections
## Data Layer
- Is concerned with media access control (MAC) and transmission error detection
- MAC-Methods can be grouped like so:

## Application Layer
- Is concerned with data in- and output, provides interfaces for programmers
# Applied Protocols
## IO Protocols
### RS232 & RS422
- RS232 and RS422 are asynchronous protocols
- RS232 simply measures whether the voltage is high or low whereas RS422 measures the difference of the voltage in 2 cables
### SPI
- Serial Peripheral Interface is a synchronous protocol
- It is a master-slave(s) protocol
- Different slaves share everything except, SS (slave select)

## Traditional Field Buses
### CAN
- Controler Area Network is a protocol mainly used in the automotive area
- CSMA/CA
### Profibus
- Master-slave protocol supporting multiple masters through token passing
## Industrial Ethernet Protocols
### EtherNet/IP
- IP stands for **industrial protocol** 
- Built as an application layer on top of standard Ethernet
### Profinet
- Process Field Net
- Uses provider-consumer architecture
- != Profibus over Ethernet
### EtherCAT
- Uses on-the-fly processing
