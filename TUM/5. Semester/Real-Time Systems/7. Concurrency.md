# Introduction
- **Concurrency** describes code being run in parallel instead of sequentially
- Processes being run in parallel on any amount of processors is called **multi-processing**
- Subsequences within a process being run in parallel is called **multi-threading**

- **Moore's Law** predicts a doubling of transistors on a chip every two years, approximately doubling performance
- The speed of memory accesses does not keep up with this $\to$ **memory wall**
- Higher clock frequencies result in more heat, which can't be handled $\to$ **power wall** 
# Processes
- [[1. Grundlegende Konzepte Betriebssysteme|Processes]] are instances of a program being executed 
## Attributes
- If the execution of a process can be suspended, it is calles **preemptable**
	- **Fully preemptable** processes can be suspended at any point
	- Other processes only allow suspension at **preemption points**
- **Periodic processes** are released with a fixed frequency
- **Aperiodic processes** occur irregularly and without a fixed, repeating time interval, possibly triggered by an event
- **Sporadic processes** have a hard deadline and are driven by an external event
# Concurrency
- **Cycle by cycle interleaving**: Instructions from different threads are loaded into the pipeline
- Next instruction from the same thread only enters pipeline when last instruction exited it
- If only one thread is available, **explicit-dependence lookahead** is performed
- In **block interleaving**, a single thread is executed until a blocking event

## Ressource Access Protocols
### Non-Preemptive
- Forbids preemtion of a process during a critical section, by giving a process entering the critical section the highest priority
- After leaving the critical section, the priority is decreased again
### Highest-Locker Priority
- A process entering a critical section gets the highest priority of all processes that might use the resource
### Priority-Inheritance 
- A process inherits the priority of the highest priority it actually blocks
### Priority-Ceiling 
- Each ressource is assigned a **ceiling**, meaning the highest priority of any process that might ever use it
- A process can only enter a critical section if its priority is higher than the ceilings of all currently locked resources
