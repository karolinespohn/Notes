# Supervised Learning
- In supervised learning, a training sample $X_{\text{train}} = \{x_1,...,x_N\} \subseteq \mathcal X$ has a corresponding target $y_{\text{train}} = \{z_1,...,z_N\} \subseteq \mathcal Y$
- The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing it to predict the correct output for new, unseen data
- During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labeled outputs.
- Common applications include classification and regression
# Unsupervised Learning
- In unsupervised learning, the training sample does not have a corresponding target
- The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures within the data, such as grouping similar data points together
- Common applications include clustering
