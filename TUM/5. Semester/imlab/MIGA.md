# Gamification
- Students prefer courses with gamification over courses without (Gamified learning in higher education: A systematic review of the literature)
# Scoreboard
## Research
- Scoreboards were shown to increase performance (Do points, levels and leaderboards harm intrinsic motivation,  gamification of task performance with leaderboards)
- This might be associated with goal setting 
- There could be the concern that this decreases intrinsic motivation (competition), but this suggests it isn't a problem (Do Points, Levels and Leaderboards Harm Intrinsic Motivation? An Empirical Analysis of Common Gamification Elements)
- "Leaderboards in an EFL course: Student performance and motivation" paints a picture critical of leaderboards, because performance was only encouraged up to the max threshold, but i think our case is different. also the second group knew they were assigned points and just didn't know their standing
- 
## Implementation
- Leaderboards are known to... 
	- Increase engagement and participation
	- Enhance performance 
- Display first 5/7 places (low places might be humiliating to the student, studies show that this lowers Motivation: implied in Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes )
## Open Questions
- Performance should probably be measured by some certain query, not by tests
- We were allowed to change tests (remove ""), so this could lead to incorrect scores
- Is it ok that I use supabase for backend?
- How was the scoreboard implemented so far? What was the performance measured by? 
- How can I access all gitlab data
# Badges
## Research
- badges affect performance positively
## Implementation
## Open Questions
# Probabilistic Rewards
## Research
- Single Lottery (lottery in last session)
- Optimism bias; people are more likely to think good things happen to them than to others
- Probabilities aren't percieved linearly - low probabilities are overweighted, high probabilities are underweighted
- Weaker students are more likely to be motivated, stronger students dont feel demotivated
- There should be threshold, where reward is quaranteed
## Implementation
- For each "good action", students get "tickets"
- Students get tickets for: 
	- Passing an assingment
	- Being high on the leaderboard
	- Presenting in class
- In the last session, a ticket is drawn and the person whose ticket it is, wins something (i.e. umbra stickers, sql mug, chocolate)
 - This would be an addition to the scoreboard, and not be separate from it
## Open Questions
# Performance Graph
- Affects performance positively
- Badges were perceived as an engaging and motivating feature (Cakıroglu, Basıbüyük, Güler, Atabay, and Memis)
# Authentication: 
- Wie werden die daten uebermittelt, wer imlab zugewiesen wird? Gibt es einen weg die emails zu extrahieren? 
# General Open Questions
- Performance measurements: How? do we just add a query to the test and benchmark that? Can we get the measurements from google test?
- API key
- Is it ok that i use supabase?
