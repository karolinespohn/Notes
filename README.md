# Uni Notes
- In the "TUM" folder, you will find a collection of my 3rd semester Uni notes at TUM
- They look nicer in Obsidian
- If you find any mistakes, you're welcome to open an issue and I'll fix it
## Structure
- There's a folder for each subject
- In each of these, you can find a file with the title of the course
- In this file, you can find my flashcards and links to my notes
- Flashcards will be available a day after a lecture at the soonest, since Anki takes 24h to update shared decks
## Mistakes
- If you find any mistakes in my notes, you are welcome to open an issue and I will look into it as soon as I get to it

Enjoy :)

# Other topics
- Sometimes I write notes on non-TUM related topics. 
- These are probably not as interesting for you, but you are welcome to read them anyways
